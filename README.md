# MBTA-App
Quick project for MBTA schedule board

## Problem Statement ##

Do you think you could use [MBTA's API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api) to build a website that shows a commuter rail departure board? Just in case, here's what a real-life departure board at [North Station looks like](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:North_Station_departure_board.JPG). We're not looking for any fancy styling, just something that can be quickly put together and works.
